Download and run validation tests on all the curated models from BioModels https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels.
The final step is to run the model in tellurium,
only models specified in SBML with a matching SEDML file are run in tellurium.
Errors or validation failures are reported at each step.
Outputs to the Markdown Table below.

'valid-sbml-units' enforces strict unit checking, 'broken-ref' indicates that the SEDML file contained
a broken source='model.xml' reference which was corrected to the name of the model's provided SBML file.
