Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.<br>        - 4 warnings of type Modeling practice (80701). The following is the first warning at line 32, column 12:<br>          - As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a parameter should be declared rather than be left undefined. Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.<br>             The parameter with the id 'I' does not have a 'units' attribute.<br>  <br><br><span style="color:red;">The COMBINE/OMEX did not execute successfully:<br><br>  The SED document did not execute successfully:<br>  <br>    could not convert string to float: 'Values[W]'<br></details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <details><summary>pass</summary>The file extensions suggest the input file types are '['SED-ML', 'SBML']'.

Doing so improves the ability of software to check the consistency of units and helps make it easier to detect potential errors in models.<br>           The parameter with the id 'I' does not have a 'units' attribute.<br>          <br>        - As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a parameter should be declared rather than be left undefined.
