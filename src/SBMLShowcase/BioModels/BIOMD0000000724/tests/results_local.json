13 warnings of type SBML unit consistency (99505). The following is the first warning at line 2568, column 6:\r\n          - In situations where a mathematical expression contains literal numbers or parameters whose units have not been declared, it is not possible to verify accurately the consistency of the units in the expression. \r\n             The units of the <initialAssignment> <math> expression 'LCK_switch' cannot be fully checked. Unit consistency reported as either no errors or further unit errors related to this object may not be accurate.\r\n        - 15 warnings of type Modeling practice (80701). The following is the first warning at line 1946, column 6:\r\n          - As a principle of best modeling practice, the units of a <parameter> should be declared rather than be left undefined.
